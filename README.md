Hello world

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

1. the rgb values are floats because they're all between 0.0 and 1.0, meaning they must be floats because they're all fractional values
2. the bounce variable is an int because you can't get a fractional bounce
3. It was missing a semicolon

 (we are table 2)
(rhythm game method)

The method should return a boolean and take a float as a parameter. We're assuming the float/range that contains the time the player was supposed to hit the button exists somewhere else in the class, and this method would take the float for when they hit the button and compare it with that value, and return either true or false. 

metaphor

Classes are like categories and class components are like things within the category. For example the "animal" category/class would have cats, dogs, horses etc (the items in the category) which would represent the class components. 

The reason the balls turn white after bouncing so many times is because (ok so I think this is it idk) the color values are in hex, and every hex code has a corresponding number in binary. Every time we multiply this number by 1.5 the number increases, making the hex code get "closer" to the highest number you can get in 6 digit hex which is ffffff, which is also pure white. hence why after enough bounces the balls turn white.
