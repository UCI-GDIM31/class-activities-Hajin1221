Hello world

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

1. the rgb values are floats because they're all between 0.0 and 1.0, meaning they must be floats because they're all fractional values
2. the bounce variable is an int because you can't get a fractional bounce
3. It was missing a semicolon
